Graphical User Interface (GUI) :
A GUI (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual
components for computer software. A GUI displays objects that convey
information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. The
objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.
GUI is an interface that allows users to interact with different electronic
devices using icons and other visual indicators. The graphical user
interfaces were created because command line interfaces were quite
complicated and it was difficult to learn all the commands in it.
GUI objects include icons,  cursors and buttons. These graphical elements
are sometimes enhanced with sounds, or visual effects like transparency.
